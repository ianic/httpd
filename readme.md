# httpd 

HTTP/HTTPS static file server in Zig 

- Linux only, uses Linux specific io_uring and kernel TLS
- min Linux kernel version is 6.16. io_uring is not supported on old kernels, and features are added in each version, httpd depends on features added in kernel 6.16 (direct pipe file descriptors).
- should be build with latest master Zig

## Example

Run `script/site.sh`, that will checkout an example site (ziglang.org), create https authority and site certificate, build project, ask sudo pwd to enable kernel tls if module not loaded and start httpd. 

To run httpd in release mode with some higher resources and precompressed site files run `script/start.sh`.

To remove browser https certificate error add certificate authority to trusted with `script/trust_ca.sh` (works on Arch Linux, not tested on others).

## Precompress files

httpd can serve compressed files if they exists on the disk. There is `compress`
command to prepare compressed files. It uses system gzip, brotli ans zstd
binaries so they must be on the system.

To compress site files run: 
```sh
$ httpd compress --root site/root --cache site/cache
```
where root is `root` of the site and `cache` folder for storing compressed files. Each compressible file will be compressed by gzip, brotli and zstd.

To use precompressed files start httpd with the same cache argument:
```sh
$ httpd --root site/root --cache site/cache --cert site/cert_ec
```
Client will be served with best match. Shortest file in format which is supported by the client. 

## Kernel TLS

```sh
# check if module is enabled
lsmod | grep tls

# enable module
sudo modprobe tls

# enable permanently
# cat /etc/modules-load.d/gnutls.conf
echo tls | sudo tee /etc/modules-load.d/gnutls.conf
```


## Benchmark

Using [oha](https://github.com/hatoo/oha) to generate load.


Run `script/start.sh` to start httpd and then generate some load, for example:
```sh
ulimit -n 65535
script/targets.sh http 8080 && oha -z 60s --urls-from-file site/targets-oha -c 10000 -w --cacert site/ca/cert.pem
```
`script/targets.sh` will create oha targets file for all files in site/root, so requests are made for each file in the site. 


`script/bench.sh` will compare requests per second of httpd with Nginx. Nginx is
using single worker thread, configured to my best knowledge similar to httpd:
sendfile and ktls enabled.

It will run load with different number of concurrent connections 1/100/500. '1 close'
is  single concurrent  connection without  keep-alive; closing  connection after
each request. Forces tls handshake on each https request.

Example of `script/bench.sh` results:
